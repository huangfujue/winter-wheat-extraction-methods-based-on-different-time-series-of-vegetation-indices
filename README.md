# winter wheat extraction methods based on different time series of vegetation indices
This part of the code is my thesis code written in 2021.  Contains GEE code and matable code.  
All codes have source code links in the first line, which are commented out in the first line. The realization of the whole paper includes MATLAB code and GEE code, which is JS code and needs to be run on the Web side. But for now it works, You can copy this code directly to the Ole Earth Engine Code Editor and run it. The hyperlink below is the original link and you can also run it by clicking on it.
